Glad & awesome to see that's there's translation option now at the bottom of the lyrics on some songs, but only to a few selected songs — ver few. It'd be awesome if it's available to all non english songs to have this option too. 3 stars for now for that. I will go back & edit the stars when they finally make that option available to all non english songs. Thanks!\",\n",

I would like to enjoy the Spotify as always. (7/31/2022) --- I'm editing my review today (8/21/2022) because the Spotify has been working excellent. I don't know what happened since I wrote the first review, but now every function is working nice, even the lyric resource. Thank to the Spotify team! 3 1 None Patrícia Marçal\n",

It does take a moment to load in, which can be annoying, but once it loads there is no trouble. Overall, a great app for music and podcasts alike.

In order to get it to play I have to restart my phone.(EVERY TIME) And once a episode stops, guess what, I have to reset my phone to play the next one. My girlfriend also uses the app she has the same issue. And Spotify doesn't seem to care, because this has been going on for months and they have done nothing to address these issues, despite the negative reviews. This app is worthless. 1 11 None Jenesis 91\n",

But there is no way I can keep paying £10 for premium every month. £5 I'd understand and I'm fine with £10 for 3 months but £10 per month?!?! Also, Spotify free on mobile is very limited. You can only skip songs 6 times per hour, you can't chose what song you wanna play most of the time and the ads are relentless. 3 3 None Zoe Herbert\n",
