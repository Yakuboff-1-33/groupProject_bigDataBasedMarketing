2022-12-12 05:54:46,Previous issue of control bar seems to have been corrected overall.

2022-12-12 05:34:25,"(Premium Account) As simple as that if you have premium account it works fantastically ignoring some minor bugs which are removed with updates. I have also used free version of this app, few days back it was also a good option but with latest updates they mould there app in such a way that you are forced to take premium. Intentionally they remove so many basic features and increasing advt to make user experience more annoying. Final verdict - 'There is no free lunch' same goes with songs.",4,Nihanshu Jain,

2022-12-12 05:06:11,"I have always loved Spotify and loved that it connected so well and seamlessly with my computer, phone, car, and more without having to work too hard. However, the Android experience of this app can be a bit frustrating at times. Certain things, like not being able to swipe down from the Now Playing song back to whatever page I was previously on, make the Android experience less enjoyable. It's just surprising when Apple gives Spotify nothing but trouble with features and updates....",4,Ethan Dutton,

2022-12-12 04:55:17,"Getting better and worse in turns. Latest update is WORSE. Is it really a new feature that you cannot skip back/restart the current song? Playlist view has changed for much worse. You cannot search, sort, or reshuffle the playlist. Cannot find ""next up"" list of the tracks in queue in an active playlist. Skips limited. I pay for Unlimited, is this a push to pay for ""proper"" premium - or are these updates launched across all Android devices? (The layout looks suspiciously like the free account...)",4,Laura Oksa,

Only way I can listen to my Playlist is having to go back to my Playlist and hit shuffle again. Only for it to play 3 or 4 more songs again. It's ridiculous.

2022-12-12 03:51:39,"The app is great at the beginning. You get to choose the artists that you enjoy listening to and can even make playlists of your favorite songs. After about maybe a week using the app you can no longer make choices and have limited access to your playlists unless you pay for a subscription. Without the subscription, they give you a bunch of playlists to choose from and you can still hear many of your song choices even though some are overplayed. But with that in mind, the service is decent.",3,Susan Coelho,

PROS-The amount of music they have is great. The songs they recommend to you are spot on. Spotify has a lot of options, podcasts & shows, audiobooks, biggest hits, popular radio. In all, I would recommend Spotify. The app is nice. However, the little cons build up and get kinda annoying. Overall great app. 👍",3,Hannaw,

2022-12-11 19:51:32,Constantly says no internet!! It'll play fine for a little bit and even when it seems like we have no internet it'll play perfectly fine. Then when we're in a highly populated Internet with 50+Mbps speeds and 5g it'll just randomly say no internet and stop playing!!! It's sooo frustrating!,1,justin beamon,

You have to go pick another random song somewhere then go back into your playlist. Then do it all over again next time you open the app. Just get the app to work properly then leave it be.

2022-12-11 19:32:06,Great for downloading new music and deleting the downloads as soon as I get bored of the song. This is much more inexpensive and convenient than buying from iTunes or other companies that sell MP3/m4a files. The App does lag sometimes that's why I have it 4/5.

I liked the ""play something"" command and it would pick for me. There needs to be a surprise me button or a section for recommendations. I don't want to listen to the same music every day.

2022-12-11 04:14:10,25 years ago Winamp was released. Somehow it could keep a catalogue of downloaded tracks without losing it halfway through playing. Somehow it could shuffle a playlist and keep on playing without aborting halfway through. Somehow it managed to not get confused about which client was playing on an account. It did all of this for free. This overengineered SUBSCRIPTION service trash cannot. You'd have to wonder how after 25 years you've made mp3 players worse in every possible way.,1,Gregory Fahey,
2022-12-11 04:14:02,"Don't know if this is just a premium feature, but it shouldn't be. I can't open any song lists unless it's a playlist that I have made myself. For instance, every time a new album is released, I like to go and open the song list to add the new songs to my new music playlist. Now I'll simply have to google the song list and look up every single new song in an album. Though miniscule, this is something that is very frustrating. I don't want to individually type in and add 20+ songs from an album.",4,Sadie,"Hey there. This is now an expected behavior on the free service on mobile. We appreciate the feedback though.

If you have a playlist, you can't view the entire tracklist on there to, unless you click the edit button. And you can't even choose a song! It picks random ones.

Every time I close it out completely from the background it either loses my place in my playlist (I listen to it from start to finish in alphabetical order bc the shuffle algorithm sucks) and skips back to the beginning OR it gets stuck on a loop of 6 songs in the playlist and I have to go in and reset my queue or else listen to the same 6 songs repeatedly.
